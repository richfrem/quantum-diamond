# How-To Guides

This directory contains the essential "how-to" guides that walk you through the key processes of the Quantum Diamond Framework. These are practical, step-by-step instructions for getting started and iterating on your projects.

## 📋 Guide Overview

| Guide | Purpose | When to Use | Key Concepts |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **[HowToStartYourProject.md](./HowToStartYourProject.md)** | Initialize AI partners for new projects | Starting any new project | AI partner initialization, Path A (apps) vs Path B (agents), Phase 0 setup |
| **[HowToIterateAndImprove.md](./HowToIterateAndImprove.md)** | Use specialist agents for code improvement | After prototype creation | Inner loop iteration, specialist consultation, hygiene-first approach |

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

### For Complete Beginners:
1. **Start Here:** Read `HowToStartYourProject.md` to understand the two paths
2. **Choose Your Path:** Apps or Agents
3. **Initialize:** Follow the step-by-step instructions
4. **Iterate:** Move to `HowToIterateAndImprove.md` for refinement

### For Experienced Users:
- **Quick Reference:** Use these guides as checklists for framework processes
- **Troubleshooting:** Refer back when you need to reinitialize or restart the inner loop

## 🔗 Integration with Framework

### Framework Phases:
- **Phase 0 (Setup):** `HowToStartYourProject.md` - Initialize your AI partner
- **Genesis Cycle:** Creative prototyping with your initialized AI partner
- **Inner Loop:** `HowToIterateAndImprove.md` - Specialist consultation and refinement
- **Engineering Cycle:** Production hardening with framework rigor

### Related Resources:
- **Playbooks:** `../playbooks/` - Detailed workflow guides for each framework phase
- **Prompts:** `../PROMPTS/` - AI specialist prompts for different domains
- **Templates:** `../templates/` - Reusable scaffolds and patterns
- **Documentation:** `../docs/` - Checklists, anti-patterns, and hygiene guides

## 📖 Reading Order

1. **HowToStartYourProject.md** - Always read this first
2. **Framework Playbooks** - Follow the appropriate workflow
3. **HowToIterateAndImprove.md** - When you need expert feedback or refactoring

## 🔧 Key Processes Covered

### Project Initialization:
- AI partner setup and specialization
- Secure foundation establishment
- Path selection (apps vs agents)

### Code Improvement:
- Codebase snapshot generation
- Hygiene inspection requirements
- Specialist agent consultation
- Iterative refinement workflow

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Hygiene First:** Never consult specialists without running `npm run hygiene:full` first
- **Clean Sessions:** Always start specialist consultations in new chat sessions
- **Snapshot Required:** Generate fresh codebase snapshots before each consultation
- **Error Resolution:** Fix all hygiene ERROR findings before proceeding

These guides are designed to be practical checklists that ensure you follow the framework correctly while maintaining flexibility for your specific project needs.
