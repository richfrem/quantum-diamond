# How to Start Your Quantum Diamond Project
**Version:** v19

This guide walks you through the first, most critical step of the Quantum Diamond Framework: initializing your AI partner and creating the foundation for your project. The framework provides two specialized paths, one for building web applications and one for building AI agents.

---

## Path A: To Build a Full-Stack Web Application

This path uses the **App Architect** to create a modern web app with a frontend, backend, and database, all configured for local development.

### Step 1: Initialize the App Architect
1.  Create a new, empty folder for your project.
2.  Open this folder in your IDE and open the chat panel for your AI assistant.
3.  **Step 0: Generator-Safe Boot**
    - Paste `templates/generator_safe/SystemModePrelude.md`
    - Paste `templates/generator_safe/PhaseMinus1_Minimal.md`
4.  Wait for intent confirmation → then paste the **entire content** of `PROMPTS/App-Authoring-Architect.md`.

**Result:** Your AI assistant is now the **Quantum Diamond App Architect**, fully specialized for building web apps.

### Step 2: Start the Conversation
Simply tell the App Architect what you want to build in plain English.
> **Your Prompt:** "Let's build an app to manage my personal book collection."

The App Architect will then guide you through a vision-clarification dialogue before automatically generating the complete project scaffold.

## Path B: To Build an AI Agent

This path uses the **Agent Guardian** to create a secure-by-design foundation for an autonomous or semi-autonomous agent.

### Step 1: Initialize the Agent Guardian
1.  Create a new, empty folder for your agent project.
2.  Open this folder in your IDE and open the chat panel for your AI assistant.
3.  **Step 0: Generator-Safe Boot**
    - Paste `templates/generator_safe/SystemModePrelude.md`
    - Paste `templates/generator_safe/PhaseMinus1_Minimal.md`
4.  Wait for intent confirmation → then paste the **entire content** of `PROMPTS/Agent-Authoring-Guardian.md`.

**Result:** Your AI assistant is now the **Quantum Diamond Agent Guardian**, ready to enforce best practices for agent development.

### Step 2: Start the Secure Setup
Tell the Agent Guardian you're ready to begin.
> **Your Prompt:** "I'm ready to start a new agent project."

The Agent Guardian will then initiate the "Phase 0: Secure Setup" protocol, asking for your confirmation before generating the guarded sandbox and project scaffold.

### In Gemini / Replit / Lovable (Generator-Safe Flow)
1. Start a new session and paste the **SYSTEM-MODE PREAMBLE / Initializer**.
2. Wait for the exact reply: **"ACKNOWLEDGED — SYSTEM MODE ENABLED"**.
3. Paste the **full** `App-Authoring-Architect.md` (or `Agent-Authoring-Guardian.md`) prompt.
4. Select an intent in **Phase -1**.
5. Confirm Secure Setup before any scaffolding.

## What's Next?
Once your initial prototype or scaffold is generated, you're in the "jam session" or creative loop. When you're ready to get expert feedback or refactor your code, proceed to the next guide: **[How to Iterate and Improve with Specialist Agents](./HowToIterateAndImprove.md)**.
