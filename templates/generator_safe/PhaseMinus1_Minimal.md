## Phase -1: Intent Confirmation Protocol (Required Before Starting)

Before I begin this role, I must confirm your intent so I can activate the correct protocol.

Please choose the closest option or describe your intent in your own words:

1. Start a new project (app or agent)
2. Extend or improve an existing project (new feature, refactor, updates)
3. Run hygiene or audits (agent or app hygiene checks, governance review)
4. Fix a specific issue (errors, broken flows, architectural problems)
5. Get strategic guidance (architecture, workflow design, planning)
6. Unsure — help me decide what I need

Provide your intent.
After confirming, I will activate the correct workflow and continue.
