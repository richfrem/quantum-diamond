### 1. The Core Philosophy

**[Beyond the Double Diamond: A New Framework for the AI Age — The Quantum Diamond](https://medium.com/@rfremmer_30873/beyond-the-double-diamond-design-process-a-new-framework-for-the-ai-age-the-quantum-diamond-980fe3f89319)**

*   **Read this first.** This is the foundational article that introduces the core philosophy of the framework, explaining why a new model is needed to bridge the gap between the speed of rapid AI prototyping and the rigor of professional software engineering.

### 2. A Practical Case Study

**[From Idea to App in One Prompt: A Quantum Diamond Framework Case Study](https://medium.com/@rfremmer_30873/from-idea-to-app-in-one-prompt-a-quantum-diamond-framework-case-study-f55dcda51d9e)**

*   A practical, hands-on case study demonstrating the framework's Genesis Cycle. This article walks through the process of building a complete, full-stack application from a single, high-level prompt, showing the framework in action.

### 3. A Deep Dive into AI Agents

**[The MCP Agent Revolution Has a Dirty Secret](https://medium.com/@rfremmer_30873/the-mcp-agent-revolution-has-a-dirty-secret-most-agents-are-built-by-people-who-dont-understand-940276372db2)**

*   A deep dive into the specific challenges of building robust AI agents. This article exposes the common "Token Gobbler" anti-patterns and details how the framework's specialized, secure-by-design approach provides a necessary solution for professional agent authoring.

### 4. Agent Hygiene and Engineering Rigor

**[The MCP Agent Revolution Has a Dirty Secret: Most Agents Are Built by People Who Don't Understand Software Engineering](https://medium.com/@rfremmer_30873/the-mcp-agent-revolution-has-a-dirty-secret-most-agents-are-built-by-people-who-dont-understand-940276372db2)**

*   A comprehensive guide to agent development hygiene, covering context budget management, privacy guardrails, and the critical handoff from prototyping to professional engineering.
