# How to Use This Framework to Build Your Web App
**Version:** v18-App

This tutorial walks you through the definitive Quantum Diamond workflow for building a **full-stack web application**.

## Step 1: Initialization: Train Your App Architect

1.  Create a new, empty folder for your project.
2.  Open this folder in your IDE and open the chat panel for your AI assistant.
3.  Your very first message is to paste the entire content of `PROMPTS/App-Authoring-Architect.md`.

**Result:** Your AI assistant is now the **Quantum Diamond App Architect**, fully specialized for building web apps.

## Step 2: The Spark & The Vision

Start with a simple, natural language prompt describing your idea.
> **Your Prompt:** "Let's build an app to manage my personal book collection."

The App Architect will respond with a **vision document** and clarifying questions, not with code.

## Step 3: Refine and Confirm

Answer the AI's questions to refine the vision.
> **Your Prompt:** "That vision is perfect. For your questions: 1. The basic fields are fine. 2. No barcode scanning needed. Please proceed."

## Step 4: The Automated Scaffold

Once the vision is confirmed, the App Architect will automatically deploy the full-stack web application scaffold and generate all the initial files for your local environment.

**Result:** You are now ready to begin the iterative "jam session" to build out your prototype with a professional-grade foundation already in place.
