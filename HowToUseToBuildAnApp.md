# How to Use This Framework to Build Your App
**Version:** v18

This tutorial walks you through the definitive Quantum Diamond workflow: **Path B, The Guided Prototyping Session**. It will show you how to use your AI Architect to build a complete, well-designed application from scratch in your local IDE.

## Initialization: Training Your AI

1.  Create a new, empty folder for your project.
2.  Open this folder in your IDE.
3.  Open the chat panel for your AI assistant.
4.  Your very first message to the AI is to paste the entire content of `04_AIA_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.

**Result:** Your AI assistant is now the **Quantum Diamond AI Architect**, fully initialized and bound by the framework's v18 protocols.

## The Genesis Cycle: A Four-Step Kick-Off

This is how you start the creative "jam session."

### Step 1: The Spark (Your High-Level Idea)

Start with a simple, natural language prompt describing the "what," not the "how."

> **Your Prompt:**
> "Okay, let's start our first project. Can you build me an app that I can use to [YOUR_CORE_APP_IDEA_HERE]?"

### Step 2: The Vision & Clarification (The AI's Response)

Following its protocols, the AI will NOT immediately generate code. Instead, it will respond with a comprehensive vision document and ask clarifying questions.

**Expected AI Response (Example for a Book Collection App):**

> *Absolutely. I will create a comprehensive **personal library application**...*
>
> ***Core Features:***
> *   *Add books manually...*
> *   *Organize books into shelves...*
>
> ***Clarifying Questions:***
> *1. For this prototype, are there any specific fields you want to capture for each book...?*
> *2. Should the app include a feature to scan a book's ISBN barcode...?*

### Step 3: Scaffold Selection (Your First Decision)

Answer the AI's questions to refine the vision. It will then ask you to choose the foundation for your project.

**Your next prompt in the chat (customize your answers):**

> That vision is perfect. Let's answer your questions:
> 1.  No, the basic fields are fine.
> 2.  No, barcode scanning is not needed.
>
> Let's proceed.

**Expected AI Response:**

> "The vision is clear. To build the foundation, which project scaffold should I deploy?
>
> 1.  **Python AI/Agent Application:** Best for machine learning, agents, and data pipelines.
> 2.  **Full-Stack Web Application (Node.js/React):** Best for modern web apps with a clear frontend and backend.
>
> You can find details for both in `07_playbook-project-scaffolds.md`."

### Step 4: The Confirmation & The Scaffold (Your Final Command)

This is your final command to start the build.

**Your next prompt in the chat:**

> Please use the **[Python AI/Agent Application OR Full-Stack Web Application]** scaffold. Adopt the **AI Full-Stack Scaffolder** persona and create the initial local-first foundation.

**Result:** The AI Architect will now generate the complete, professional-grade project structure and all initial files, ready for you to begin the iterative "jam session."
